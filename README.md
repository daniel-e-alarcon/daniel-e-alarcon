## Daniel E. Alarcon, PhD

**Applied LLM Systems • Retrieval & Evaluation**

**Sofia, Bulgaria • Open to remote roles**

I build and evaluate retrieval-based LLM systems with a focus on grounding, retrieval quality, and structured failure analysis. My background is in experimental psychology (PhD), where I spent over a decade designing controlled experiments and quantitatively evaluating behavioral data. I apply the same evaluation mindset to AI systems as measurable, testable artifacts.

## Featured Projects
### RAG Explorer (Streamlit)

A local-first Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application for document Q&A with cited sources and reproducible exports. Includes FAISS index management, provider toggle (Ollama default, optional OpenAI), hybrid retrieval (BM25/Dense), and retrieval evaluation (hit@k, MRR) across QA sets.

Repo: https://github.com/daniel-e-alarcon/rag-explorer

### AI Data Insight Dashboard (Streamlit)

Interactive dashboard for CSV-based EDA and baseline ML modeling, including cross-validation, confusion matrix/ROC (classification), residual diagnostics (regression), feature importances, and structured LLM reporting (local-first with optional OpenAI fallback).

Repo: https://github.com/daniel-e-alarcon/ai-data-dashboard

## Technical Focus

Retrieval-augmented generation, embedding-based retrieval, evaluation dataset design, answer grounding, failure taxonomies, and practical ML diagnostics.

## Tooling

Python, Streamlit, LangChain, FAISS, scikit-learn, Pandas, Git/GitHub, Ollama.
